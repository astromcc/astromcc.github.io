    <h1>A Demonstration of Bayes' Theorem</h1>

    <div class="intro">
      <ul class="head-list">
        <li class="list-header">Thomas Bayes (1701 - 1761) was an English
          mathematician, philosopher, and Presbyterian minister who
          developed a new way of thinking about data and probability.</li>

        <li class="list-header">His central concept: <i>We update our knowledge
          as data are collected.</i>
          
        <li class="list-header">These data may be observations or measurements
          of the natural world or data collected during an experiment.</li>

        <li class="list-header">The white box below is a simple playing field
          to illustrate Bayes' theorem. Your task is use the available data to
          identify where a hidden triangle is located somewhere within the white
          box.</li>

        <li class="list-header">This process is a simple model of how scientists
          gain confidence in their knowledge of the natural world.</li>

        <li class="list-header">Initially the white box below is empty.
          You have no information about the position of the hidden triangle.</li>

        <li>Click within the white box to make an initial guess about the
          location of the hidden triangle. Your guess is marked by an orange
          dot.</li>

        <li>Click the <i>Measure</i> button to receive information about the
          location of the hidden triangle. A black dot will appear at a random
          location within the white box.</li>
          
        <li>In addition, a colored region appears. This colored region shows
          whether the hidden triangle is to the left, right, above, or below the
          black data point.</li>

        <li>After you add a data point, you may update your knowledge of the
          hidden triangle by clicking inside the white box.</li>

        <li>You may click the <i>Measure</i> button and click inside the white box
          as many times as you wish.</li>

        <li>If you feel confident in the hidden triangle's location, click the
          <i>Reveal</i> button to expose the triangle's true location.</li>

        <li>You can start a new search by clicking the <i>Restart</i>
          button.</li>
