    <h1>Densities of the Terrestrial Planets</h1>

    <ul class="head-list">
      <li>How can we find the size of a planet's metal core?
        We can't dig down to it, so we must use other means.</li>
      <li>We can use density as a clue: metal is denser than rock.</li>
      <li>Choose a terrestrial body from the list below: Mercury, Venus, Earth,
        Moon, or Mars.
      <li>Use the slider to change the relative volume of metal and rock
        filling the interior of the body.</li>
      <li><b>Calculated Density</b> of the planetary body is determined from the
        mixture of rock and metal. In reality, rock and metal have various densities
        which depend on the local pressure, chemical composition, and other factors.
        For the purposes of this simulation, a mixture of iron and nickel
        is given a density of approximately 8000 kilograms per cubic meter (equal to
        8 grams per cubic centimeter) and silicate rock is given a density of 3000
        kilograms per cubic meter (equal to 3 grams per cubic centimeter).</li>
      <li><b>Measured Density</b> of <i>uncompressed</i> metal and rock in the
        interior of a planetary body. which removes the squeezing effect of the body's gravity on
        its interior. This value is determined from the body's measured mass
        and radius as well as laboratory measurements of the densities of rock
        and metal under different amounts of pressure.</li>
      <li>Increasing the fraction of metal raises the <b>Calculated Density</b>
        of the body.</li>
      <li>Adjust the size of the core to match the <b>Calculated Density</b>
        to the <b>Measured Density</b>.</li>
      <li>A match between these densities reveals the approximate size of the
        body's metal core.</li>
