    <h1>Densities of the Terrestrial Planets</h1>

    <ul class="head-list">
      <li>How can we find the size of a planet's metal core?
        We can't dig down to it, so we must use other means.</li>
      <li>We can use density as a clue: metal is denser than rock.</li>
      <li>Choose a terrestrial body from the list below: Mercury, Venus, Earth,
        Moon, or Mars.
      <li>Use the slider to change the relative volume of metal and rock
        filling the interior of the body.</li>
      <li><b>Calculated Density</b> of the planetary body is determined from the
        mixture of rock and metal. In reality, rock and metal have various
        densities which depend on pressure, chemical composition, and other
        factors.
      <li>For the purposes of this simulation, a mixture of iron and nickel
        metal is given a constant density of 8000 kg per cubic meter
        (equal to 8 grams per cubic centimeter) while silicate rock is given a
        density of 3000 kg per cubic meter (equal to 3 grams per cubic
        centimeter).</li>
      <li><b>Measured Density</b> of <i>uncompressed</i> metal and rock in the
        interior of a planetary body removes the squeezing effect of the
        body's gravity on its interior. This value is determined from the body's
        mass and radius as well as laboratory measurements of the densities of
        rock and metal under different amounts of pressure.</li>
      <li>Increasing the fraction of metal reduces the fraction of rock inside
        the body. This raises the Calculated Density of the body.</li>
      <li>Decreasing the fraction of metal increases the fraction of rock inside
        the body. This decreases the Calculated Density of the body.</li>
      <li>Use the slider to adjust the size of the metallic core of the body to
        match the Calculated Density to the Measured Density.</li>
      <li>A match between these densities reveals the approximate size of the
        body's metallic core.</li>
    </ul>
